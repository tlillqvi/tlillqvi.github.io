        <h3>DIV entry-content H3: The missing header</h3>
        <p>When opening the page via http(s) it works but not through file://. Also it works differently on Safari and Firefox. The page title is shown on Firefox but not on Safari. And the text "Insert semi-random text ..." is not visible on Firefox but shown on Safari.</p>
        <p>This article tries to trigger the reader view in Safari by following the instructions found here:
          <a href="https://www.readability.com/developers/guidelines#reader">Readability</a>. To avoid having very short sentences this one was added for the purpose of filling the page with text, not with fillament.</p>
        <p>In other news this is the text of the second paragraph. A second sentence was added after no reader was triggered on Firefox. Perhaps even a third sentence is needed to make the text horribly long and unreadable.</p>
        <p>A third paragraph has been added here to extend the text even further. Now there is plenty of text but no sign of the reader view as of yet.</p>
        <h3>DIV entry-content H3: Another header of a lot of text</h3>
        <p>A lot of text will follow this little text that paves way to a lot of text. A number of letters form a sentence. The sentences follow each other to provide the bulk of the text. This article is such that the bulk of the text has no meaning other than acting as place holder text lorem ipsum.</p>

          A version of this article appeared today. For some reason this text doesn't make it into the reader view.
